<p> Since the subject of natural language processing is language, of course, it is deeply related to linguistics that study language itself and language cognitive science that explores the inner description of language phenomena. Mathematical and statistical tools are widely used for implementation, and also visualization is sometimes required to obtain insights in this process.
    We found that there is no Korean NLP open source library which includes visualization. Korean language preprocessing has more difficulties than other languages. Especially for novice developers, it is difficult to use the library easily because they are inexperienced. So weâ€™re trying to add visualization to the existing Korean-NLP open source, so that people can realize the preprocessing results fast and briefly. We expect that automating the process would greatly help in improving people's productivity. </p>
